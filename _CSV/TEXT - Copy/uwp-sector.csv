Regina/Regina (0310-A788899-A) Date: 097-1105

Officials of the General Shipyards on Regina announced that it has
completed negotiations with Tukera Lines to locally manufacture L-Hyd drop
tanks for use on high-capacity commercial vessels. General will assemble
components at its more modern facilities on Pixie (0303-A1001030-D). The
first production examples are expected to be available within six months,
at which time Tukera Lines will begin high capacity service from the
interior. Component assembly will be carried out at General's more modern
facilities on Pixie (0303-A100103-D).

L-Hyd drop ships have only been in service for the last dozen years in the
interior, being made possible by recent advances in the field of capacitor
engineering, a joint press release explained. Commercial vessels equipped
with the new generation of long-storage jump capacitors carry jump fuel in
specially designed L-Hyd drop tanks in excess of their rated tonnage. Upon
conversion of the fuel to the massive energy required for jump, the drop
tanks are explosively jettisoned through the use of break-away connections
and explosive bolts. Jump is executed when the remains of the tanks are a
safe distance from the vessel.

A spokesman for General Shipyards explained that local yards are not yet
capable of manufacturing the long-storage capacitors required for the
process, but that production of the drop tanks is possible, thus allowing
the high capacity starships of the Tukera Lines to begin service to the
Regina subsector.

L-Hyd tanks are not reusable, and thus increase the absolute cost per jump.
However, experience has shown that the increase in cargo tonnage resulting
from the elimination of internal J-fuel storage more than makes up for
this, the press release explained.

The joint press release concluded by stating that local manufacture of
L-Hyd drop tanks marks the dawn of a new era of commerce and prosperity in
the Regina subsector. Following the announcement, common stock in
Oberlindes Lines plummeted 27 points on the Regina exchange before trading
was suspended. Officials of Oberlindes Lines were not available for
comment. [JTAS #2]

Regina/Regina (0310-A788899-A) Date: 101-1105

Close on the heels of the joint announcement by General Shipyards and
Tukera Lines that L-Hyd drop tanks would soon be manufactured in the Regina
subsector, came word by express boat from the Imperial core that a decision
has been made to deploy Jump-6 L-Hyd drop tank express boats on all major
express routes. Initial feasibility studies indicate that such a system
could average jump-5.5 per week by executing maximum jumps, and leaving
current xboats to disseminate information between the new major relay
points. The system is expected to cut communication time to the Imperial
hub to under 25 weeks. The Initial System Deployment Schedule indicates
that the Regina subsector can expect to be fully integrated into the
network within a decade. [JTAS #2]

Regina/Regina (0310-A788899-A) Date: 201-1105

Last night a series of explosions ripped through Vehicle Assembly Building
No 3 of the General Shipyards facility on Pixie. Both company and military
investigators on the scene report that the damage was almost certainly the
work of saboteurs.

General Shipyard's Vehicle Assembly Building No 3 housed the main assembly
line for the production of L-Hyd drop tanks. The L-Hyd drop tank project,
undertaken in conjunction with the Tukera Line (of Vland/Vland), is
expected to open up the Regina subsector to high capacity commercial access
from the interior. A spokesperson for the company reported that the
explosions probably set the project back by at least three months.

Imperial Navy Commander Lobeck hault-Donosev, the naval system liaison
officer on the L-Hyd project,

high General Shipyards press secretary Harcord Haveln discounted any
political motives for the sabotage. "There are commercial concerns in the
subsector", he said, "who place their own self-interest above that of the
population as a whole." When pressed to explain, he refused to elaborate.
The naval liaison officer to the L-Hyd project, announced that Naval
Counter-Intelligence was exploring the possibility that the sabotage was
the work of Ine Givar terrorists. Ine Givar activity in the Regina
subsector has thus far been limited to scattered and ineffective strikes on
Efate and Feri, but that this incident "definitely bore their signature,"
he explained.

The public affairs officer of the Pixie office for Naval
Counter-Intelligence refused an interview later in the day, but issued a
press release disavowing any responsibility for the remarks of Commander
hault-Donosev and stating that the NCI had no evidence whatsoever of Ine
Givar activity on Efate, Feri, or Forboldn. [JTAS #3]

Regina/Regina (0310-A788899-A) Date: 224-1105

General Shipyards has reported 276 confirmed break-ins of its scrapyard at
Regina during the last six months and is considering instituting a "take a
number" system. [JTAS #3]

Pixie/Regina (0303-A100103-D) Date: 241-1105

The joint investigative commission released the findings of its
investigation into the mysterious series of explosions that ripped through
General Shipyards' Vehicle Assembly Building No 3 three months ago today.
The two page report concluded, contrary to initial statements, that there
was no evidence of sabotage and that the explosion appeared to be due to
equipment failure resulting in simultaneous discharge of liquid hydrogen
and oxygen, which was detonated by sparks from a short circuit in a flux
welding unit which had been inadvertently left on at the end of the evening
work shift.

Public attention had been riveted on the investigation since it was
revealed that the explosions had seriously set back the production of L-hyd
drop tanks, equipment necessary to the opening of the high-capacity
commercial service between Regina subsector and the Interior.

An initial oublic statement by Naval Commander Lobeck hault-Donosev, the
former project-liaison officer, had suggested Ine Givar terrorist
involvement in the incident, and had mentioned Ine Givar activity on both
Efate (Regina 0105) and Feri (Regina 0405). A subsequent Naval
Counter-Intelligence press release denied any Ine Givar activity on Efate,
Feri, or Forboldn (Regina 0208).

When the Naval Counter-Intelligence representative on the joint commission,
Lieutenant Artura Gramlyn, was questioned about the inclusion of the planet
Forboldn in the denial statement, he replied "Well, there isn't any Ine
Givar activity on Forboldn. There isn't any Ine Givar anywhere in the
Subsector. We are familiar with all Ine Givar activity, and there isn't
any." [JTAS #4]

The Traveller's Aid Society regrets to announce the indefinite closing of
its class A facility on Efate (Regina 0105-A646930-D) and the posting of
that world as an amber travel zone. Gutted during a recent firefight in the
administrative capital, there are no immediate plans to repair the facility
until civil order has been restored on Efate.

In the event that travel to Efate is necessary, a society travel agent
remains on duty and can be reached through the offices of the Oberlindes
lines at Down-Franklin Starport. Travellers are advised however, to avoid
travel to this world if at all possible. [JTAS #4]

Dentus/Regina (0601-C979500-A S) Date: 361-1105

Word was recieved today that two weeks ago the Imperial Battle cruiser
Adamdun mistakenly engaged and destroyed the merchant craft Bloodwell of
the Oberlindes Line. The Bloodwell, according to the crew of the battle
cruiser, was not showing its ID transponder signal and would not answer
broad-beam hails. The Bloodwell was under full acceleration, and after it
refused to change vector in response to laser warning fire, it was engaged
engaged by high-G missile fire and destroyed. A subsequent (and
unsuccessful) search for survivors resulted in the identification of the
ship.

Oberlindes Lines officials called the story "an obvious cover-up of a
tragic display of incompetence." and claimed that the Bloodwell's ID
transponder had just undergone its annual maintenance check, and could not
have failed to function. As in all commercial vessels, the ID transponder
was supposedly tamper-proof, and are could not have been turned off by the
crew. Legal action is expected. [JTAS #5]

Regina/Regina (0310-A788899-A) Date: 004-1106

The Traveller's Aid Society has obtained an exclusive interview with Major
Windan Lorimer, Imperial Marines (ret.), recently returned from six months
of duty as a captain of auxiliaries engaged in counter-insurgency actions
on Efate (Regina 0105-A646930-D).

In the interview, Major Lorimer revealed that four months ago his battalion
became engaged in a firefight and subsequently captured twenty insurgents,
two of which were officers. Subsequent medical examination revealed that
one of the two was actually a Zhodani officer serving as an advisor to the
Ine Givar cadres.

In response to queries concerning Major Lorimer's claims, Rear Admiral Lord
Santanocheev, CINCNINT/RS (Commander-in-Chief, Naval Intelligence, Regina
Subsector) today held a press conference during which he claimed that Naval
Intelligence was convinced that there was neither Zhodani or Ine Givar
involvement in the Efate disturbances.

"What we have on Efate is a local, very minor situation. We're handling it
with local forces and a few mercenary contingents. If it were serious, we
could commit army or marine assets. We have some very potent assets in this
subsector, but we haven't felt the need to commit them. This is not a
serious situation,", he reported.

When asked about the report of a Zhodani officer, Lord Santanocheev
replied, "Naval Intelligence has this man in custody, and I can assure you
that he is not a Zhodani officer, or a Zhodani anything. I fought the
Zhodani twenty years ago in this subsector. I know the Zhodani, and this
man is not a Zhodani."

When contacted afterwards, Major Lorimer refused to comment on the
Admiral's remarks, beyond insisting that his original reports had been
accurate. [JTAS #5]

Efate/Regina (0105-A646930-D) Date: 148-1106

Reliable sources in the defense establishment have admitted in private that
the Imperial Army's 1197th Separate Light Infantry Brigade has been engaged
in counter-insurgency operations in the Vandere district of Kormoron
(Efate's northern continent) for the last eight months. When asked to
comment on Rear-Admiral Lord Santanocheev's recent claim that no Imperial
army or marine units had been committed, they declined. One official did
explain, however, that the brigade was only employed in mopping up
operations and had been inserted only to allow rotation of indigenous
troops out of combat. "Once all the local units in Vandere have had a spell
in the rear, the 1197th will be pulled out," he said. [JTAS #6]

Regina/Regina (0310-A788899-A) Date: 186-1106

A spokesman for Tukera Lines announced indefinite suspension of high
capacity commercial service to the Regina subsector pending outcome of the
official investigation of the Trimkhana-Brilliance tragedy.

Less than a month ago, the 800-ton liner Trimkhana-Brilliance was lost with
217 lives due to a jump capacitor discharge immediately prior to jump.
While all four survivors of the disaster are still under intensive medical
care, interviews with the one surviving crew member indicate that the
capacitor discharge may have been due to a delay in jump after full
charging due to a failure of the port inboard L-Hyd drop tank to separate
completely.

A Tukera Lines press release stated that a team of company engineers would
be "taking a long hard look at General Shipyards' quality control
standards."

In the wake of the announcement of high-capacity service suspension,
General Shipyards common stock fell 34 points in the Regina exchange before
exchange officials suspended trade. Oberlindes Lines stock closed up 5 3/8.

Ruie/Regina (C776977-7) Date: 003-1107

Military authorities in the Jingarlu army on this non-Imperial frontier
world are apparently encountering difficulty hiring mercenary striker units
for use along the Jingarlu-Nebelthorn border. For over a year, border
tensions between the two nations have been increasing, and numerous
incidents have caused the normally stormy relations between the two
governments to break down altogether.

Jingarlu has often hired mercenary units from the Spinward Marches of the
Imperium to beef up its border constabulary in times of tension, but such
units are largely unavailable at the moment. Jingarlu authorities speculate
that large scale Imperial Army hirings in the Regina subsector for use on
Efate may be the cause of the shortage, but reliable Imperial sources deny
that hirings have been higher than normal. [JTAS #7]

Deneb/Deneb (A-000895-E) Date: 021-1107

A message boat, two months out of date, has arrived from the Old Islands
subsector with word of extensive fighting in that remote, non-Imperial
region. Old Islands subsector, due to its astrographic location, has never
been integrated into the Imperium. The combination of fairly uniform tech
levels, aggressive trade policies, and numerous autonomous governments have
traditionally made it an area of continuing instability. It now appears
that the instability has erupted into open warfare. [JTAS #7]

Regina/Regina (0310-A788899-A) Date: 054-1107

Reports over the course of the last several weeks of a marked increase in
piracy in the coreward reaches of the subsector have been substantiated by
Navy officials in a routine press release. In today's weekly press
briefing, a naval spokesman confirmed that an unusually large amount of
shipping had failed to make scheduled planet-fall and that no
communications from the Kinorb Cluster had been received for over two
months.

When questioned further, Public Relations Officer Lieutenant Commander
Vanderheydt hault-Josephson pointed out that fewer than ten ships had been
scheduled to make the little-used Kinorb-Pixie run in that period, and
difficulties at Riesling Down Starport on Kinorb could easily explain the
situation. However, hault-Josephson added that the Navy had not ruled out
the possibility that piracy from "a source or sources unknown" could be
responsible.

In response to the situation, hault-Josephson announced that the battle
cruiser Agidda, until yesterday under order to join the squadron at Efate,
was instead being routed to join her sister ship Adamdun in the Kinorb
Cluster and report back on the situation. The dispatch of Agidda was
further described as "purely precautionary." [JTAS #8]

The small brushfire war that has sputtered off and on for several years on
