"The Julian Protectorate: Astrographical Overview","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate is a mixed-race (primarily Human and Vargr) confederation to core-trailing of the Imperium, in what is traditionally referred to as the Vargr Enclaves.  It encompasses all but two systems in Amdukan sector, the trailing two-thirds of Mendan sector, the spinward thirdof Arzul sector, and the coreward third of Empty Quarter sector.  Minor presences in Antares, Star's End, Trenchans, and Ogzuekhfos sectors roundout the Protectorate proper; additionally, there are polities in Windhorn,Meshan, and Mendan sectors which, while not members of the Protectorate,generally coordinate policy and action with the Protectorate."
"The Julian Protectorate: The Tetusu-Dene Scale","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: The Tetusu-Dene Scale----------------------------------------------

The Tetusu-Dene Scale was developed in the Imperial Spinward Marches as an
aid to recognizing Vargr integration into Human societies on the Imperial
Core-Spinward frontier.  It has been adopted (in slightly modified form) by
the Julian Protectorate to recognize the level of integration of societies
within the Protectorate.

The Modified Tetusu-Dene Scale is interpreted as follows:

0:  Insufficient Contact - The world has not had sufficient contact with
    the other species for any attitude on interaction to have developed.
    
1:  Total Xenophobia - Members of the dominant species are bent on the
    extermination of the other.  Attempts to extend extermination policies
    to other worlds will be made.
    
2:  Passive Xenophobia - Murder of the other species when found on the planet
    is routine, and generally government policy.  If political repercussions
    are involved, deportation may occur.  Under no circumstances will an
    ambassador of the other species be accepted, and relations with states
    with less xenophobic attitudes are never warm.
    
3:  Enslavement - Members of the other species are regarded as fit only to
    serve the dominant species as slaves.  Importation and breeding is
    carefully controlled.
    
4:  Alienation - Members of the other species are generally confined to
    reservations, except where it suits the convenience of the dominant
    species to permit otherwise.  Crimes against the other species by the
    dominant species are generally not prosecuted; crimes by the other
    species against the dominant species generally are punished by long terms
    of imprisonment or forced labor, by extremes of corporal punishment, or 
    by death.

5:  Strong Apartheid - Members of the other species are granted limited
    rights.  Some prosecutions of serious crimes against the other species
    may occur.  "Free" movement may be permitted, possibly under a system of
    travel passes.  Participation in government by the other species is
    barred, and franchise or equivalent is unavailable.

6:  Weak Apartheid - Members of the other species are permitted to
    participate in government, though they may be barred from many higher
    offices.  Franchise or equivalent may be extended, but limited in scope.
    Many occupations are closed to members of the other species, and
    restrictions on social activities are common.  Facilities provided by
    the government for use of the other species are inferior to those
    provided for the use of the dominant species.  Segregation is mandatory
    on the part of the other species, voluntary on the part of the dominant
    species.

7:  Legislative Equality - Members of the other species are not treated
    differently at law.  Segregation of most activities occurs, and may
    or may not be mandatory.

8:  Formal Integration - Legal segregation is nonexistent, and forced
    segregation of most activities may be illegal.  Segregation is either
    nonexistent or very informal and very limited, and viewed with distaste.
    Intimate relationships between members of different species are unusual,
    and meet social resistance.

9:  Total Integration - Both species participate in society on a fully equal
    basis.  Deliberate segregation on any level is considered unacceptable,
    and possibly provocative.  Intimate relationships between members of
    different species are not considered unusual.

The original Tetusu-Dene Scale assumed that, in an unequal relationship
between the species, Humans were dominant.  As this may not be the case in
the Julian Protectorate, Tetusu-Dene evaluations of 7 or less are suffixed
with V for Vargr-dominated cultures, or H for Human-dominated cultures.

"The Julian Protectorate: The Ziru Sirka and the Rule of Man","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: The Ziru Sirka and the Rule of Man
-----------------------------------------------------------

At the height of Ziru Sirka dominance, most of Meshan, Mendan, and Amdukan
sectors were under the control of the Vilani Makhidarun bureau, with some
control of the Mendan Main and its surrounds shared with other bureaux.
These areas, along with the rest of the Ziru Sirka, fell under the control
of the Rule of Man at the conclusion of the Interstellar Wars, but even
before that time, the area served to attract Solomani traders.  The influx
of Solomani traders increased during the Rule of Man, and their experience
and familiarity with the area came to the notice of Emperor Hiroshi II, who
appointed such individuals to planetary administration, replacing the
military administration of the area.

In addition to the appointment of experienced traders as planetary
governors, a Solomani development company, Scorpion, in cooperation with
the Vilani Sharurshid bureau, recruited colonists for the development of
the Antarean region.  These two factors contributed to a vibrant, thriving
region which prospered while the rest of the empire decayed.


"
"The Julian Protectorate: The Coming of the Vargr","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: The Coming of the Vargr
------------------------------------------------

As the Rule of Man decayed, Vargr settlers, who had obtained Jump drive 
from the Vilani in Corridor and Windhorn sectors, finally rounded the 
coreward end of the Windhorn Rift and entered the area.  While initial
reaction was positive (the Vargr were viewed as a potentially useful
resource), raiders and corsairs inevitably followed, and just as inevitably,
conflict between human and Vargr resulted.  This conflict did little to
build trust between the races, but remained relatively low-key until the
spark of the Sack of Gashikan.

"
"The Julian Protectorate: The Sack of Gashikan and the Vargr Race Wars","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: The Sack of Gashikan and the Vargr Race Wars
---------------------------------------------------------------------

In -1658 (Imperial), a Vargr corsair attacked the garden world of Gashikan,
using nuclear weapons and pillaging the world.  The human inhabitants of the
world suffered global holocaust.  The resulting reaction included reprisals
against neighboring Vargr communities, and a series of bloody wars inflamed
racial hatred between Human and Vargr as far away as Antares.

In -1646, human worlds uniting against the Vargr formed the Second Empire of
Gashikan, whose founding principles focussed on the extermination of the
Vargr as a race, on the basis of a perceived threat posed by the Vargr to
the very existence of Humaniti.  Early efforts to expel the Vargr from
Gashikan sector fell short of full success, and Vargr retaliations inflamed
fears of the humans in the area.  Fear and hatred of the Vargr persisted and
became rooted in Gashikan society, and influenced human states to rimward.

The Second Empire of Gashikan, taking advantage of anti-Vargr xenophobia,
embarked on a campaign to bring other human planets under its domination,
in the guise of offering them protection.  Many planets accepted; others 
who refused were brought into the Empire by force, in a fierce war of
unification.  Eventually, the Second Empire of Gashikan controlled most of
Gashikan sector, much of Trenchan and Mendan sectors, and had minor holdings
in Meshan and Gzaekfueg sectors.

Although the Gashikan Navy continued to operate vigorously against the Vargr,
the Race Wars are generally held to have ended in -1000, and the anti-Vargr
prejudice, while still dominant, now had the opportunity to die down.

"
"The Julian Protectorate: The Vargr Enslavements","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: The Vargr Enslavements
-----------------------------------------------

After the end of the Vargr Race Wars in -1000, tolerance for Vargr grew in
areas outside the Second Empire of Gashikan.  Vargr settlements on planets
that humans considered undesirable were accepted, provided that the Vargr
posed no threat.  Even where a threat was perceived, humans intervening
preferred to enslave the Vargr rather than exterminate them.  Inside the
Empire of Gashikan, the situation was quite different.  Vargr caught within
the Empire were invariably killed immediately.  Outside the Empire, Vargr 
slavery grew to enormous proportions, and became a dominant industry in the
area, reaching a peak around -300.  Continued Vargr immigration and the
occasional emancipation, coupled with increasingly tolerant relations between
human and Vargr, resulted around this time in a larger number of free Vargr
than those still enslaved.  Although it would remain a major industry for
quite some time, Vargr slavery began a long, slow, decline.


"
"The Julian Protectorate: The Menderes Emancipation","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: The Menderes Emancipation
--------------------------------------------------

On Asimikigir, the Menderes Corporation was becoming a major corporation.
Its power was due primarily to the large number of Vargr slaves it owned,
which comprised most of it labor force.  Unlike other slave-owning 
corporations, however, the Menderes Corporation made a strong effort to
ensure that its Vargr slaves were happy and well-treated, and felt that 
they were leading rewarding lives.

In -321, the Menderes family head, Karik Menderes, took the forward-looking
step of emancipating all of the Menderes Vargr, making them employees rather
than property.  Although done for economic reasons, the emancipation sparked
a Vargr Emancipation movement on Asimikigir that eventually resulted (in
-302) in the complete outlawing of slavery on Asimikigir.  The trend spread
quickly to other worlds, aided in part by the Menderes corporate attitude
that racism and business didn't mix.  Although the Menderes Corporation did
not actively advocate this point of view, and in fact would set aside these
attitudes where necessary to do business, the example that they set by merely
existing turned into a powerful force for change.  This resulted in increased
opportunity for lucrative dealings between Vargr and human.

The Menderes Corporation again took a forward-looking step in -275, when 
Tran Menderes broke the effective monopoly that Kudukara Lines, a human-owned
and -operated company from Gashikan, had on interstellar transport in the
area.  At the time, there were few worlds outside Gashikan that could build
starships - but in Meshan sector, there were Vargr that could and did build
them, and made an offer to carry Menderes goods off Asimikigir to other
worlds.

"
"The Julian Protectorate: The Trade Wars","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: The Trade Wars
---------------------------------------

When Tran Menderes accepted a Vargr offer to transport Menderes goods, he
started a trend.  Other Vargr traders approached Menderes, where they were
met with a positive reception.  The resulting trade association was both
controversial and widely criticized, as was the Menderes Corporation, but
Tran Menderes stayed his course, and eventually, with Vargr technical
assistance and a mixed Human-Vargr labor force, the Menderes Corporation was
able to launch its first starship in -247.  Under the successors to Tran
Menderes, the Menderes Corporation launched and generally won half a dozen
trade wars against Kudukara Lines, and grew to connect the Vargr Extents
with the Vargr Enclaves, profiting enormously from the Vargr trade.

"
"The Julian Protectorate:  The Rise of the Third Imperium","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate:  The Rise of the Third Imperium
--------------------------------------------------------

The rise of the Sylean Federation, and its conversion into the Third Imperium
by Cleon Zhunastu's proclamation, passed largely unnoticed in the region.
However, astute observers would realize that the proclaimed connection with
the First and Second Imperia presaged a play for Imperial dominance in the
region.  This was largely ignored until the Antarean Pacification Campaign,
in which the rimward portion of the Menderes trading sphere fell to the
expansionist forces of the Imperium.  At the same time, reports came 
filtering in that showed a lack of Imperial toleration for the Vargr, and
an apparent preference for force and intimidation rather than diplomacy and
negotiation in dealing with Vargr, at least in Corridor sector.  These
reports ignited anti-Imperial sentiment in the coreward areas of the Menderes
sphere.

The Menderes family and companies began an anti-Imperial propaganda campaign,
building common cause between Human and Vargr in resisting continued Imperial
expansion.  To Vargr, the poor treatment afforded Vargr in Corridor and other
areas of the Imperium was made the focus of the propaganda; to Humans, it was
the specter of a possible Imperial claim to the coreward portions of the 
former Ziru Sirka.  The Menderes campaign was largely successful, and when
Imperial scouts and diplomats entered the region as ambassadors of goodwill,
they were largely rebuffed.

"
"The Julian Protectorate: The Julian War","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: The Julian War
---------------------------------------

The diplomatic overtures from 166 on being unproductive, in 175, Emperor
Martin I ordered Imperial fleets into Mendan sector, in an effort to 
accomplish by force what couldn't be accomplished by negotiation.

The region was divided into a number of small polities, but these rallied
to the Asimikigir Confederation, the Menderes Corporation and family, and
in particular Julian Menderes, the family head, when he became Regent of
the Asimikigir Confederation in 178.  Julian commanded the respect and
loyalty of both humans and Vargr in the Confederation, and he proved an
able leader as well.  Taking advantage of Vargr resourcefulness and human
determination, Julian Menderes was able to create a protectorate organization
whose military arm, the Star Legion, was able to repulse the Imperial forces
by 185, and to capture most of the Antares region by 191, when the Imperium
was forced to come to a formal peace agreement.


"
"The Julian Protectorate: The Julian Protectorate Forms","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: The Julian Protectorate Forms
------------------------------------------------------

With the peace treaty in 191, Julian Menderes was able to convert 
the wartime protectorate organization into a permanent authority, the 
Julian Protectorate, with the Star Legion as its armed forces.  This change
was more nominal than actual, as its primary purpose is to resist Imperial
expansion, rather than act as a governing state.  As part of the peace
agreement of 191 with the Imperium, a cluster of worlds in Antares sector
was granted autonomy as the League of Antares, and Julian Menderes was able
to ensure that the people in positions of power were from families that had
come coreward as refugees during the Pacification Campaigns.  The cluster is
today largely sympathetic to the Protectorate, and, although Imperial
domination of the cluster is complete, no attempt to revoke autonomy or to
reintegrate the cluster by force has been made, largely because of the 
certainty of a response from the Protectorate.

"The Julian Protectorate: The Decline of the Protectorate","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: The Decline of the Protectorate
--------------------------------------------------------

With peace between the Protectorate and the Imperium, the Protectorate's
defensive alliance against the Imperium waned as a binding force between
the members.  Members went their own way in foreign relations and trade,
with the Protectorate doing little more than establishing standards for
interoperation (to ensure that, if the Star Legion were again needed, 
maintenance and communication between various worlds' and confederations'
detachments would not suffer).

"The Julian Protectorate: The First Resurgence: The Imperial Grand Survey","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: The First Resurgence: The Imperial Grand Survey
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the late 380s through the early 400s and 410s, Imperial scouts attempted
to survey the worlds of the Protectorate for the Imperial Grand Survey.
These attempts caused concern that the information was to be used for
military or intelligence purposes, and presaged another war.  The
Protectorate "beefed up" the Star Legion and ordered it out on patrol, and
many worlds refused cooperation with the Scouts, resulting in soured
relations between the Imperium and the states of the Protectorate.  The
Imperium resorted to clandestine operations in Protectorate space, and in
spite of Protectorate efforts to prevent it, most of the area had been
surveyed to Imperial Class III standards by the time of the publication of
the Survey, in 420.

"The Julian Protectorate: The Second Resurgence: The Vargr Missions and the","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: The Second Resurgence: The Vargr Missions and the
Hidden War
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 382, Emperor Martin III of the Imperium ordered a series of Alien Missions
to learn about the alien races with whom the Imperium had contact.  These
missions included xenologists and other researchers, journalists, and
diplomats.  The Vargr Mission, from 486 to 499, met a cool reception from
Protectorate worlds, and, althout anti-Imperial feeling had ebbed since the
Grand Survey, radically anti-Imperial factions attempted to incite worlds of
the Protectorate to turn away the Imperial emissaries.  When these attempts
failed, the radicals resorted to terrorism and corsair raids, hiring bands
of pirates and corsairs to attack the Imperial ships.

Cleon IV, unwilling to tolerate continued harrassment of the study mission,
ordered Imperial Naval Intelligence to counter the anti-Imperial activity in
the area, in a "Hidden War" lasting from 488 to 494.  Although the Naval
efforts were largely successful, they were widely publicised in the 
Protectorate, and anti-Imperial feeling surged.  In spite of the cessation of 
harrassment, the Imperium elected to terminate the Vargr Mission early, in 
499, and move on.

"The Julian Protectorate: The Third Resurgence: The Second Imperial Survey","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: The Third Resurgence: The Second Imperial Survey
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

As with the original Grand Survey in the 380s to 410s, the Second Survey
prompted fears of espionage directed at a possible war to incorporate the
Protectorate area into the Imperium.  While the Imperium did not resort as
heavily to clandestine operations as during the Grand Survey, and relied
more on diplomacy, there were nevertheless some incidents between the Star
Legion and clandestine Scout operations that contributed to the damaging
of relations with the Imperium.

"The Julian Protectorate: Associated States: The Confederation of Bammesuka ","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: Associated States: The Confederation of Bammesuka 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Confederation of Bammesuka is a weak, decentralized interstellar 
state left over from the collapse of the Second Empire of Gashikan.  
In many respects, the culture here parallels that of the Confederation 
of Mendan; however, the Confederation government does not have the 
resources to exercise control of the area, and the little control that 
it does exercise is undermined by corsairs based in the Confederation 
and by raids conducted by other corsairs based in the Sarkan 
Constellation, the Zuugabish Tripartite, and Meshan sector.

Tetusu-Dene Evaluation: 4H
Gashikan attitudes toward Vargr are for the most part preserved here, 
and reinforced by corsair activity.  Nevertheless, weak as it is, the 
Confederation government has been attempting to moderate those 
attitudes.
"
"The Julian Protectorate: Governmental Structure of the Protectorate","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: Governmental Structure of the Protectorate
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Julian Protectorate is a confederation whose primary purpose in
being is mutual protection of its members.  Individual members
conduct their own foreign policy and trade policies; mediation
between member states and Protectorate-wide communications services
are provided by the Protectorate, as is a consistent and fair
system of interstellar law.  The Protectorate also defines
standards for equipment and protocols to ensure interoperability
and coordination.  The Star Legion is a standing armed force which
is maintained by the Protectorate, and supplemented in times of
crisis by additional forces maintained by the member states.

Members of the Protectorate are not constrained as to size or
political structure; they range from individual nations on
balkanized worlds to multi-world confederations containing
dozens or hundreds of worlds.

The head of the Protectorate government (and, coincidentally, of
most of the member confederations) is titled "Regent", a practice
dating back to the period of the Rule of Man, when new regional
governors took that title while performing the duties of Governor
and waiting for their appointments to be made official by the
Empire.

The main deliberative body of the Protectorate is the Protectorate
Council, which is divided into two chambers: The Chamber of Worlds,
in which each world receives one representative, and the Chamber
of the Protectorate, where each member state receives one
representative.  The Council is empowered to offer membership in
the Protectorate to non-member states; it is also empowered to
accept or reject an application for membership from a non-member
state.  A non-member that makes application to the Protectorate,
but whose membership is declined, may choose to coordinate its
interstellar laws and standards with the Protectorate, and may
also agree to Protectorate mediation in disputes with a member
state.  Non-members that do this, and formally notify the
Protectorate of these decisions are automatically granted the
status of Associated States.

In addition to membership in the Protectorate, each member state
or associated state maintains its own government, foreign policy,
and trade agreements.

"
"The Julian Protectorate: Aliens of the Protectorate: The Hhkar","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: Aliens of the Protectorate: The Hhkar
--------------------------------------------------------------

The Hhkar are known to have been a spacefaring race for longer than any
other sophont race in Charted Space.  Several worlds in what is now
Hikaru Subsector have extensive pyramidal ruins, the youngest of which
is over ten thousand years old.  The most extensive of these ruins was
found during the Vilani Imperium period, on Urinir (since renamed
Skkyhrk by the Hhkar, upon their return).  It was thought that the race
that built those ruins had been destroyed by plague; the return of the
Hhkar near the end of the Long Night, in -222, came as a shock to the
Vargr who inhabited that planet.

Hhkar starflight was not based on jump drive; they acquired jump drive
from the Vargr upon their return.  The Hhkar migrations were done via
regular space ships operating at relativistic velocities and fueled by
ramscoops.  The reason for the migrations - and the return - are
unknown; the Hhkar have shown no willingness to discuss the issue.

Current hypotheses, based on the limited information that xenologists
have been able to obtain, mostly from traditional stories and religious
writings of the Hhkar, suggest that the Hhkar homeworld of Ssrar
(location unknown) was geologically violent.  This forced the Hhkar to
develop a nomadic culture, although they did develop the practice of
building permanent structures.  These structures were left intact when
a Hhkar ssaaahk (clan or race) migrated away, and were often used by
ssaaahk that later entered the area, or by the original builders if
they returned to the area even centuries later.  There is a certain
amound of reverence for such structures; very little is done to change
them when they are reused.

The nomadic culture, coupled with increasing population, made
competition between ssaaahk, and eventually war between them,
increasingly common.  To reduce conflict, a system of dominant and
subordinate ssaaahk was developed, paralleling in many ways the
structure of dominant and subordinate clans among the Aslan.

Because of the lengthy period in which the Hhkar culture adapted to 
being spaceborne, many Hhkar today still prefer to live shipboard, in 
orbital cities.  Many of these cities are jump-capable, allowing the 
residents to maintain their nomadic lifestyle, although they tend to 
remain within or very near the Hhkar Sphere.

For reasons unknown, the Hhkar left their homeworld around -50,000, and
colonized other worlds, including Urinir and nearby worlds.  Again,
there is no indication of a reason for leaving them around -10,000, and
no indication of why they chose to return in -222 (or, more accurately,
why other Hhkar ssaaahk chose to occupy the worlds at that time).  The
Hhkar recolonization of -222 originally aimed to exterminate completely
the human and Vargr society present on the world; Vargr emissaries were
able to negotiate a complete surrender after three years of war.  The
terms of surrender included the destruction of non-productive members
of the society (the elderly, the disabled, and the unemployed); a total
ban on new births was also part of the terms.  Today, there is only a
small population of (Vargr) non-Hhkar present on the planet; these are
descendants of original inhabitants who rejected the surrender to the
Hhkar and went into hiding.  They remain for the most part in
subterranean tunnels; the Hhkar do not actively hunt them down, but
they are killed on sight.

Over the next 500 years, the Hhkar expanded their sphere of occupied
worlds, following similar patterns.  The expansion was brought to a
halt in 377, when Commodore David Lindquist of the Star Legion was able
to almost defeat the Hhkar at Kargan; the Hhkar were so impressed by
Lindquist's tenacity and cleverness that when he was captured, he was
given an honorable execution, and the Hhkar withdrew from the system in
spite of having been victorious.  There were subsequently several
skirmished with the Star Legion, but the Hhkar gradually entered a more
cooperative relationship with the Protectorate and with the Menderes
Corporations.  Today, the Menderes Corporations have sizeable
industrial holdings within Hhkar territory, all operated by the Hhkar.


Hhkar Physiology and Sociology
------------------------------

Hhkar are evolved from a reptiloid carnivore/killer.  They are roughly
humanoid in appearance, but still show their origins in the heavy claws
at the end of each of their three fingers on each hand, and in the
heavy tail used for balance.  They stand, walk or run with a
forward-leaning posture, tail extended behind them or used as a "third
leg" at rest.  Like most known reptiloid species, Hhkar possess scales.

The Hhkar show as much variety within their species as do humans.
Social relationships are based on a "racial" grouping, called a
"ssaaahk", where common characteristics define the group.  The ssaaahk
has the first loyalty of the individual Hhkar, even above what many
humans describe as "loyalty to self" - the needs of the ssaaahk have
absolute first priority, and obedience to the ssaaahk and the patriarch
thereof are absolute.  There is a large group of Hhkar individuals who
do not exhibit the racial characteristics that identify them as a
member of the ssaaahk into which they were born; these individuals are
second-class citizens (raaabr) within Hhkar society.  It should be
noted that most such individuals are killed as juveniles; the raaabr
citizens are those who survive to adulthood and are ejected from their
ssaaahk.  If they exhibit the characteristics of a different ssaaahk,
they may petition for admission to that ssaaahk; it is usually several
generations before such a petition is granted.  While an individual is
an outcast from all ssaaahk, he will generally be found as a
servant/employee of a ssaaahk.

Hhkar are adaptable to many tainted atmospheres; while they require 
oxygen to survive, they prefer atmospheres laden with sulfur compounds 
that humans would consider heavily polluted, exotic, or worse.  They 
are also capable of thriving in atmospheres that contain other taints 
as well.  In untainted atmospheres, Hhkar must take precautions 
analogous to those that humans must take in tainted atmospheres.

Hhkar are meat-eaters, but everything we have learned about the Hhkar 
indicates that meat alone is insufficient to sustain them.  The best 
information available to us indicates that the atmosphere of their 
original homeworld provided many nutrients through respiration; 
however, due to geological activity, the availability of those 
nutrients varied.  To correct for this, the Hhkar started inhaling the 
smoke from burning certain kinds of vegetable matter, sometimes treated 
with minerals.  This allowed more leisure than eating killed animals 
did, and gradually assumed the social function in Hhkar society that 
eating does in most human societies.  The practice took on additional 
importance after the Hhkar started settling worlds with alien 
environments.  Social smoking customs among the Hhkar have been adopted 
by other races in the protectorate; similarly, the Hhkar have adopted 
some of the customs of the societies that they have come in contact 
with, and cultivate tobacco and other plants used by humans and Vargr 
for smoking.  Hhkar will almost never be found smoking in the presence 
of humans or Vargr; many of the substances and compounds that the Hhkar 
smoke are unpleasant, noxious, or worse to those races.

Hhkar are oviparous, with gestation taking about 21 weeks.  Juveniles
are lighter of frame and faster and more agile than adults.  They are
capable of taking a place in society within weeks of hatching, although
they do not reach full growth and maturity until age 22.  The average
adult Hhkar is over 2m in height and masses over 250kg.

Hhkar all begin life as males, changing genders later in life, up to
six times throughout their lifespan of almost 200 years.  As females,
Hhkar enter estrus and mate once per year.  A typical clutch contains
one to six eggs; these eggs are deposited in a central communal area,
heavily guarded, called the "Caves of Life".  Juveniles are supervised
by females, who will defend them with their lives.  The females are
also responsible for killing those juveniles deemed deformed, slow to
learn, or difficult to control.

Gender change involved biochemical changes that culminate in shedding
of the skin.  This also has a renewing effect, so that a Hhkar does not
suffer from aging effects as most other sophonts do.  There are also 
significant psychological changes involved in a gender change; Hhkar 
changing genders lose all skills specific to the old gender - but when 
they change back, those skills are regained.

As demonstrated by the gender change, there is a strong connection 
between the Hhkar's mental state and his physiological state.  The 
Hhkar have developed or discovered several mental states which induce 
or enhance physical capabilities or changes, and their medical science 
and spiritual life is based around the interaction between mind and 
body.  The mental states range from a state of suspended animation, 
wherein most life processes come to a virtual halt (and do not count 
against the Hhkar lifespan), through several "dreaming" states, used 
for different purposes ranging from spiritual insight to logical 
analysis and decision making, and into a number of fully waking states, 
ranging from a low-mentation laborer mode up to learning and combat 
modes.  In addition, there are a number of "medical" modes, used to 
enhance the body's ability to repair a wide variety of injuries and 
illnesses.

Because of the nature of Hhkar mentality, they rarely use drugs - drugs 
cause an imbalance between the mind and the body, which results in 
extreme mental stress and the altering of the consciousness state into 
any one of several extremely undesirable modes.

Psionic capability among the Hhkar has not been studied.  The Hhkar 
believe that psionics cause the perversion of the soul, and make it 
impossible to achieve the higher spiritual states of consciousness.  
Their aversion to psionics is sufficiently strong that a known psionic 
of any race is guaranteed a violent reaction, whether the powers are 
actually used or not.

"The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Hegemony of Lorean","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Hegemony of Lorean
--------------------------------------------------------------

The Hegemony of Lorean is one of the largest member states of the 
Protectorate, in terms of the number of member worlds, if not the 
largest.  Nevertheless, its influence in Protectorate affairs is 
limited due to lack of proximity to major trading or diplomatic 
partners (other than the Rukadukaz Republic), and its own political 
priorities involve local development.  It is one of the most active 
supporters of the Development Division of the Menderes Corporations, 
and a sizeable percentage of the Division's activities are focussed on 
the Hegemony.

The Hegemony of Lorean is the only active proponent within the 
Protectorate of pursuing relations with the K'kree outposts to 
trailing; Lorean efforts at promoting the K'kree trade have generally 
been met with disinterest by both the Protectorate and the K'kree.  
Nevertheless, promotion continues at a low level due to the potential 
that such trade has for increasing the importance, and therefore the 
influence, of the Hegemony in Protectorate affairs.

Tetusu-Dene Evaluation: 7
Social segregation is not a matter of policy in the Hegemony; rather, 
it is a result of perceived psychological and sociological differences 
between the races.  In general, interspecies relations are amicable, 
and members of the two species will work together without incident.

The Glimmerdrift Reaches sector was developed by Judges Guild in 1981.
It was declared invalid by GDW in 1984.

Since the sector was produced before it became common practice to give
population multipliers, number of planetoid belts, or number of gas giants in
sector data, these numbers have been left as 0, except with gas giants where 0
indicates the absence of any and 1 indicates the presence of an indeterminate
number. There were also a few subsectors where it was possible to have a
reasonable guess at population multipliers. These have also been included.

Whilst transcribing the data I have tried to preserve as much of the feel of
the original product as possible. Please bear in mind that this sector was
published in the early eighties, and as such is far 'rougher' than the sectors
which are published today. In transcribing the data, I found many examples
where the planetary data conflicted with the accompaning text. I have made no

"Magyar - Credits","Magyar","Magyar - Credits
----------------

The original data for this version of the Magyar sector was ftped from
the Sunbane archives.  Since only one subsector was fully named in
that version (subsector N, "Bobbo"), I have added my own subsector and
system names for the rest of the data, except that I also made sure
the names for subsectors D, H, L, & P agreed with the data in
Supplement 10: The Solomani Rim. I've also added jump routes, alien
races, some history and information on trade routes and shipping
lines, as well as the types of military bases found in the sector.
Once again though, I would like to point out that I am NOT responsible
for naming a subsector "Bobbo!" :)

In connecting the borders of the Solomani Rim to Magyar, I was able
to keep almost all the same jump routes across the border, although
in several cases the direction had to be changed.  I did have to
make two noncanonical changes to the SOLOMANI RIM to make sense
of the data:

1. I added a jump route from Jardin-Theseus into the Morency subsector.
2. I added a jump route from Albadawi-Beal into the Fugue subsector.

Jim tells me that Magyar was covered in one of the Traveller
Chronicles, but I have not had the opportunity to see that issue. 
If anyone could send me a copy, I'll revise this version in
accordance with the published material. 

In creating Magyar sector, I had to ignore the data generated by Andy
House's "Imperial Scout Service Guide to the Universe."  I did so
because it disagreed with both the Sunbane data and the very limited
information on Magyar in the Solomani Rim supplement.

If anybody has additions to Magyar, please send them to either Jim or
I so that we can add them to the present data.  Thanks!

"ALIEN SENTIENTS OF MAGYAR SECTOR","Magyar","                ALIEN SENTIENTS OF MAGYAR SECTOR

The majority of Magyar's sentient races are friendly to humans
-- the Masuk-Safor, the Morgenstern Airlords, the Raaqua, the 
Whaiz and the Zil --  and all but the Zil are spacefaring.  There
are only two races hostile to humans -- the Akzukayya and the
Obopodel -- and neither is spacefaring.  There are two neutral 
races -- the Glidips and the Grayhost -- of which only the Grayhost
is spacefaring.  Two other sentient races may exist (the Callers-
in-the-Dark, & the Jakaso crystals), but the existence of the
Callers and the sentience of the Jakaso remains unproven.  Only
two of these races achieved star travel before aided by humans,
these being the Masuk-Safor and the Grayhost.

AKZUKAYYA:  A race of a 50 kg. insectoid carnivores (killers).  The
adults have six legs, two manipulative arms, and a prehensile tail,
all encased in a thick armor equivalent to cloth armor.  They are
extremely fierce and territorial.  Because of their warlike nature,
they are currently interdicted on their homeworld.  Homeworld: 
Namedih.

CALLERS-IN-THE-DARK:  A legendary race of ghosts or mist creatures
who live in deep caverns.  According to most accounts, the Callers
appear as a rainbow of color, swirling before the viewer.  Source
of Legend:  Koskiku.

GLIDIPS (aka. McNellan's Snake, or Glidersnakes):  A race of 50 kg.
flying omnivores (eaters) with a rough green skin that counts as
jack armor.  A small head and snakelike body are supported 
in flight by a trio of small overlapping frilly wings on either
side, with the rear set of wings meeting behind the body proper.
Along the bottom of their body are two rows of legs, like those 
of a centipede.  Glidips are non-spacefaring and communication with
humaniti remains limited, but vids and stills of Glidip art are 
popular through-out the sector.  Homeworld:  McNellen.

THE GRAYHOST:  Colonies of microscopic organisms who unite into a
single sentient amphibious entity ranging in size from 50 to 400
kg. or more.  The Grayhost are an ancient spacefaring race, but
communication between the Grayhost and humaniti remains minimal.
Homeworld:  Leikung.

JAKASO:  A crystalline race, typically orange in color, with whom
communication remains impossible.  The possibility of sentience has
been determined from growth patterns.  The Jakaso crystals do not
seem to be related to the Zil.  Homeworld:  Ziarko.

MASUK-SAFOR ("They who Pursue"):  A starfaring race of 1,600 kg.
marine carnivores (chasers).  The "Masuk" are narrow blue cones
centered around a jet propulsion system, with a ring of five small
manipulative arms arranged around the mouth/ramjet intake.  The
Masuk are practice Buddhism and are devoted members of the 
Confederation.  They also regard the Dolphins as unworthy
rivals, and believe that Dolphins should be replaced by the Masuk
as the new allies for humans in the water.  Homeworld:  Tooma.

MORGENSTERN AIRLORDS:  A race of winged men with black skin and
weighing an average of 100 kg.  They have small, almost midget
bodies compared to the enormous leather wings projecting from 
their backs, and their eyes are much larger than typical.  They
can fly in dense atmospheres, glide in standard atmospheres, and
are landbound in thin atmosphere.  Homeworld:  Morgenstern.
     ST:2d6-3  DX:2d6  EN:2d6+3  IN:2d6  ED:2d6-3  SO:2d6-3

OBOPODEL:  A race of 3,200 kg. marine carnivores (sirens)
resembling the giant squid of ancient Terra, the Obopodel are
hostile to all humans and non-spacefaring.  Homeworld:  Winneauer.

RAAQUA:  A race of 6 kg. airborne filters.  They look like 
jellyfish floating in the sky, and are reknowned as existential
philosophers and excellent medics.  Homeworld:  Sylva
  ST:1d2  DX:2d6+3  EN:1d6  IN:2d6  ED:1d6  SO:1d6  

WHAIZ:  25 kg. green insectoid omnivores (gatherers), with a 
a puffy sponge-like torso that serves as their digestive system,
picking up seeds after they are flailed from the stalks by 4
long torso claws. Four short but sturdy legs support the torso.
The Whaiz are known to be skillful sculptors, pilots, navigators,
and gunners.  Homeworld:  Kemper.
     ST:1d6  DX:2d6+2  EN:2d6  IN:2d6  ED:2d6  SO:2D6-3

ZIL:  A crystalline race that communicates by electrical impulses. 
In effect, they are living computers.  The Zil appear as furry
yellow crystalline growths, something like sulphur growths.  Each
individual zil only grows to 1-2 kg., but a large field of the Zil
is a beautiful sight, a brilliant yellow with message sparks
passing from one Zil to another each moment.  The Zil trade their
computing abilities to humans in return for chemicals that help
them grow.  Homeworld:  Ramanar.


               OTHER RACES FOUND IN MAGYAR SECTOR

BOTTLENOSE DOLPHINS (Tursiops truncatus galactus):  Travelling in
their "t-suits" ("travel suits":  grav-powered environment suits
with waldos), Dolphins belief in equality of all, and of course
consider themselves equal to any other race.  Length = up to 3-4
meters; Mass = up to 220-400 kg.

"MAGYAR:  General Background ","Magyar","MAGYAR:  General Background 

Magyar sector is the spinward section of the Solomani Sphere.  It
contains 516 star systems and is bounded by Canopus sector to
rimward, the Solomani Rim to trailing, the Dark Nebula to spinward,
and Daibei sector to coreward.  The sector capital of Magyar is
Uebelhor, in subsector J.

Magyar has always been a fringe sector, although the Terran
Confederation settled the sector extensively by -1770.  The Long
Night knocked most of those settlements far back or destroyed them
completely.  Subsectors D (Gadarur) & H (Walpurgis) have been
settled the longest, as you can see below:

-3500  During the First Imperium, subsectors D & part of H were 
       part of the fringes of Vilani space.  SOURCE:  Megatraveller
       Referee's Manual, p. 105.

-2204  During the Rule of Man, the Terran Confederation expanded
       into subsector L and part of P, while also establishing
       Terran control of the old Vilani territory.  SOURCE:
       Megatraveller Referee's Manual, p. 106.

-2136  Aslan achieve space travel.  SOURCE:  Alien Module 1, p. 35.

-1776  The Long Night begins for humaniti.  By this time, the 
       Solomani had already spread spinward of Kusyu, the Aslan
       homeworld in the Dark Nebula sector.  During the Long Night,
       some human worlds were absorbed into the Aslan Hierate,
       where they remain to this day.  SOURCE:  Alien Module 1,
       p. 3.

-1118  During the Aslan Border Wars, Magyar sector escaped
       curiously unscathed.  Instead of expanding to trailing, the
       Aslan launched a coreward attack from L'aheako sector (Dark
       Nebula) through Aeitle Sakh sector (Reaver's Deep) and
       against Magyar's coreward neighbor sector of Daibei,
       which bore the brunt of the fighting.  SOURCE: Megatraveller
       Imperial Encyclopedia, frontispiece; Alien Module 1.

380    Peace of Ftahair ends Aslan Border Wars.  Alien Module 1,
       p. 35.

589    By the time of the First Frontier War (589-604), the Magyar 
       sector had been inhabited by the Solomani for over 2,000
       years.

990    Subsectors D, G, H, J, K, L, & P of Magyar were involved in
       the Solomani Rim War (990-1002).  SOURCE:  Megatraveller
       Imperial Encyclopedia, frontispiece.

1002   The need to expand drives the Solomani to renew hostilities
       against the Aslan.  The Solomani are opposed by the Aslan 
       clans of Yerlyariuwo & Khaukheairl.  SOURCE:  Alien Module
       1, p. 3.

1111   Classic Traveller campaigns begin.  By this time, the
       Solomani have occupied Magyar sector for about 3,000 years.
       Subsectors D & H had been inhabited for 4,400 years!

1116   In the Rebellion era, subsectors C, D, H, & P were again
       disputed ground between Imperium and Solomani.  SOURCE:
       Megatraveller Imperial Encyclopedia, p. 4.

Magyar is currently controlled by the Solomani Confederation, which
"covers about 2,400 worlds in six sectors" and "claims nearly a
thousand more worlds in Imperial, Aslan, and neutral space."  This
claim is obviously the source of continuing enmity between the
Aslan and the Solomani.  The Imperium is more forgiving of the
Aslan, and the Imperial population is made up of about 3% Aslan.  
SOURCE:  Alien Module 1.

Magyar is a well-established sector with a rich history of human
habitation stretching three thousand years into the past.  It has 
always been a fringe sector, however, caught in the outskirts of
Vilani, Aslan, & Solomani space.  Because of this the Long Night
hit the region hard and technological levels remain much lower
than in the Solomani Rim.  This has also created a great number of
extreme conditions within the various systems, and pocket empires,
ruthless police states, and lawless freebooter worlds are the
rule rather than the exception.  Trade links to the Solomani Rim
The detente that exists between the Imperium and the Confederation
allows these trade links to remain open, so Magyar officials do
their best to discourage Solomani terrorist attacks launched from
this sector.

Magyar's proximity to the Aslan Heirate reinforces the need for
cooperation not only with the Imperium, but also with the various
disparate societies of Magyar itself.  One example of this is the 
Ockian Ring, a virtual empire unto itself within the Confederation.
Like most of Magyar's many pocket empires, it swears allegiance
to the Confederation more from need than from desire.

"POCKET EMPIRES OF THE MAGYAR SECTOR","Magyar","                    POCKET EMPIRES OF THE MAGYAR SECTOR

One distinguishing factor of the Magyar sector is the great number
of "pocket empires," ie. small empires that range in possessions
2 stars to about 20.  Their possessions may be attributed to 
either colonization, conquest, or perhaps an ancient allegiance.
Both the Imperial and Solomani zones have such empires in
abundance.  The largest of these is the Ockian Ring of Worlds,
(which controls 16 systems), Acara (9 systems), & Harpring (6
systems).  Below is a listing of all pocket empires and their
holdings:

"TRADE IN MAGYAR SECTOR","Magyar","                    TRADE IN MAGYAR SECTOR

The Ockian Ring of Worlds is one of three major trade routes within
this sector.  Each of these routes is a circular path or run over
which travel a variety of lines.  The Ockian Ring and the Keyor Run
are the two small runs, and are used by many traders.  The largest
of the three runs is the Blackjack-Ramanian circuit, which only the
megacorps have the resources and connections to milk adequately.
Nevertheless, Magyar is an excellent sector for the enterprising 
free trader, with many short jumps and a large number of worlds
where the law level is neglible.

Imperium regions of Magyar are served by Solar Shipping, based out
of Terra in the Solomani Rim, as well as the megacorps of Ling
Standard Products and Naasirka.  Confederation regions of Magyar
are served by Transstar megacorp (based out of Jardin in the
Solomani Rim), especially in subsectors K, L, N, O, & P. [SOURCE: 
Book 7, Merchant Prince, p. 12]  Two other well-established but
sector-wide companies are McKillen Lines (based out of Uebelhor)
and Vandok Shipping (based out of Ock).  There is also an
aggressive fledgling company called Overthrust Inc. (based out of
Keyor).

----------------------------------------

 NOTES:

The bulk of the data for the Crucis Margin Sector comes from the Judges Guild
Guidebook.

I have assigned allegiance codes since they are indicated only by symbols in
the Guidebook. I used the existing codes where possible and assigned new ones
as necessary. The new codes have not been used in other sources that I am aware
of, as far as I can ascertain.

I also generated data for planetoid belts and number of gas giants in each star
system. The Guidebook only indicates if there is a gas giant in the system, not
the number of them. With the exception of seven systems, (as noted below), I
have assigned the number of gas giants in each system that the Guidebook
indicated possessed one. I also generated the Population multiplier for this
Sector.


 ERRATA:  

There were a number of errors and inconsistencies in the original data, I have
listed all those I found and what I did about them below.

      circumference of 59660 km.
      The UWP for the Planet gives its size as 8 - 13600-15200 km 
      I left the figures out of the planet profile.

Chhung Kuo Subsector - Shang-Ti (2702)
      According to the profile, the Shang-Ti systems contains 2 gas giants
      and one Planetoid Belt.
      The planet listing in the Guidebook does not show either.
      I changed the data to show 2 Gas Giants and one Planetoid Belt.

Seven of the eight Planetary profiles contain information on the number of
Gas Giants and Planetoid Belts they possess and I have entered this into
the planet listing.

In addition some of the profiles mention the major product of the planet
and I have added these to the export category of the UWP, although in one
case the UWP indicates it shouldn't be manufacturing the product.

"CRUCIS MARGIN SECTOR","Crucis Margin","                          CRUCIS MARGIN SECTOR

 BACKGROUND

The Crucis Margin is located slightly rimward from the centre of the Trailing
Edge of the Imperium. No system in this sector owes direct allegiance to the
Emperor though mutual non-aggression pacts exist. The Crucis Margin is one of
the group of sectors known collectively as the Gateway Quadrant. This area of
mixed states separates the Imperium from the domains of the Hive Federation
and the Two Thousand Worlds. The sector name is derived from the largest
independent state in the sector, the Union Crucis.

There are 425 planetary systems in the Crucis Margin Sector, with a Total
Population of 737.29 billion.

 IMPERIUM INVOLVEMENT

No worlds in this sector owe allegiance to the Imperium although most systems
have a majority population of humaniti. Imperial interests are furthered
through commercial and political activity. Client States, especially Sphere
Fenix, have been encouraged to act as Imperial Surrogates.

 HIVER INVOLVEMENT

No worlds in this sector are settled by the Hive Federation although their
trading vessels are active in the Trailing Rim quarter. Significant military
forces are de-emphasised but commercial and political activity is great.

 K'KREE INVOLVEMENT

No worlds in this sector are settled by the Centaurs although trading vessels
are active in the Trailing Core quarter. Significant military forces are
de-emphasised but commercial and political activity is very high.

 MANDANIN CO-DOMINION  -  ( 82 systems )

Information concerning the precise internal structure of the Co-Dominion is
scanty and nebulous at best. It is a cooperative state with complete
integration between the two member species. Imperium historical information
appears to have been accidentally destroyed during the last Civil War. Only
fragmentary texts of previous records remain. Previous organisations in this
area appear to be clan/commercial structures of no great extent or permanence.
Several non-human intelligences were also present in the region, at least one
in the early stages of starflight. Theoretical research on hyperspace was being
conducted but there were no plans to construct jumpdrive prototypes yet. 
Alien-Human contact was peaceful and constructive. Three centuries ago a joint
Human-Alien culture started to spread out simultaneously from several nuclei
systems. Growth has been steady since then, emphasising cooperative ventures
between Human and Danin authority structures. Only a century or so ago a
militant revolution completely restructured Mandanin Society and initiated an
aggressive expansionist policy. Information of any sort about the internal
affairs of the Mandanin Co-Dominion is suppressed. Internal trade is restricted
to authorised companies and external trade is limited to several supervised
starports. Recent expansion attempts into the Marlan Primate have been
decisively defeated. Past incursions into the Krax Confederation indicate new
expansion will be aimed in their direction.

 HV'IKA KAMLIN  -  ( 6 systems )

The Hv'ika Kamlin is an independent state composed primarily of members of an
Alien Minor Race and a Minor Race of Humaniti. They are a Client State of the
Hive Federation, greatly influenced by it and militarily allied. While active
in commercial and political affairs, the predominant philosophy is not
militarily aggressive.

 RAMAYAN  -  ( 1 system )

Ramayan claims precisely one system in this sector and has not modified its
borders in this direction in over five centuries. Trade is not restricted but
most Ramayan citizens are extremely conservative and philosophically inward
directed. Political attitudes are Neutralist, though friendly towards the
Imperium. A Mutual defence treaty with Sphere Fenix has been in force for the
last three centuries.

 SPHERE FENIX  -  ( 90 systems )

Sphere Fenix was originally settled by a very diverse group of refugees from
the collapsing First Imperium. During the Long Night, these fugitives
flourished into a series of mini-states. About 500 Imperial dating, a series of
small but bitter wars broke out. In 724, the three surviving states declared
peace on each other and met to discuss reunification. Though the precise
details of governmental structure took over 28 years to develop, Sphere Fenix
dates its birth from that meeting. Though internal unrest has occurred since,
the overall prosperity has continued to increase. A mutual defence treaty was
signed with Ramayan in the 8th century Imperial. Technical assistance is
received from the Imperium Military Services and Imperial Security is rumoured
to have great influence. In spite of having fought no major wars in centuries,
military prowess is high and it has become traditional to serve a term or two
as a Mercenary in one of the surrounding states, especially the Marlan Primate. 

 CHHUNG KUO  -  ( 33 systems )

Chhung Kuo is a term from an ancient Solmani language meaning "Middle Kingdom".
It to was established close to the end of the First Imperium by refugees from
the turmoil. In order to unite the disparate elements, a deliberate attempt was
made to establish a revival of the "Golden Age of Chinese Culture". Though
primarily settled by Humaniti of Solmani ancestry, a significant minority of
the population is composed of resident Alien members of the Minor Races.
Philosophy is directed towards constructive cooperation with a conservative
respect for tradition. Both the Humaniti and the Minor Races maintain universal
military training for self defence but seldom serve as or hire Mercenaries.
Trade is encouraged and a high degree of interest is maintained in technical
progress. Diplomatic policy is defensive and mutual non-aggression pacts have
been concluded with all neighbouring states.

 UNION CRUCIS  -  ( 123 systems )

Union Crucis also began during the end of the First Imperium as a combination
of refugees for self defence purposes. In this area, though, two other factors
came into play, the presence of several Minor Races of Aliens on the planets
and the proximity of two separate Major Races of Aliens. Interspecies
cooperation and competition has always been present on the area. Humaniti, as
the most numerous portion of the population, formed the core around which
groups gradually coalesced into larger and larger political units. Open warfare
was uncommon, although small skirmishes were frequent among the different
Humaniti factions. These four factions are the Suo, Sliv, Cast, and Nar with
28, 17, 22, and 16 systems respectively, with the remaining 40 systems being
uncommitted. Many of the Suo planets have trade links with the Hv'ika and
Hivers. Most Cast and some Sliv planets trade with the Chhung Kuo and with the
Two Thousand Worlds. Around a century or so ago an expansionist political party
gained prominence in the Nar systems. Unable to expand into the Union, armed
incursions were directed into the Mandanin Co-Dominion. At first successful,
Co-Dominion counter efforts became more and more forceful, completely halting
Nar expansion. Economic pressure upon the Nar by the Suo and Cast to cease
expansion was resented by Nar. Sliv extremist groups also viewed this pressure
with extreme disfavour. At the present time internal dissent is at the highest
level it has been since  the formation of the Union Crucis. No faction is yet
willing to utilise armed force on each other but political and espionage
conflicts are increasing. All political moderates are strongly urging peace and
accommodation but the situation is fluid. The Humaniti and all major resident
Alien political factions are exerting as much calming influence as they can but
some unknown factor seems to be agitating for breakup of the Union.

 RM NAI  -  ( 6 systems )

Rm Nai involvement in this sector comprises five systems at the Spinward
Rimedge. Of Solmani extraction, the Rm Nai are xenophobic and advocates of
Human Supremacy. Internal power struggles have, over the last four centuries
since the formation of the Rm Nai state prevented expansion. A strong ruler
has just consolidated her position and now the Rm Nai are ready to move
outward.
 
"
"MANDANIN CO-DOMINION","Crucis Margin","                           MANDANIN CO-DOMINION

 The Mandanin Co-Dominion arose as the result of a combination of a mutant
strain of Danin and a religious revival. The initial impetus is now wearing off
and internal factions are beginning to crystallise.
The Danin are a warm-blooded, four limbed race of vaguely reptilian aspect.
Each Danin is tri-sexual, the various sexual phases of the ne's life. The
order is Egg (thet), Subadult (ken), Male (nit), Female (ten), and Senior (een)
Humans have taken to using the Danin words for the separate phases and the
pronoun for any Danin in general (ne).
 Developed form a social type of Gatherer, the ability of the post reproductive
phase of Seniors (een) to settle conflicts between different packs without
violence speeded up the course of civilisation among Danin. Though technical
progress was not as rapid as comparable races, planetary-wide social units were
achieved at a relatively early stage. Progress in biological and social
sciences was also somewhat more advanced that standard technical levels would
indicate. Initial contact by the Sa'Dintinn Company was quiet peaceful. The
basic philosophy of the major Danin beliefs were very tolerant in relationships
with other sentient species. Mutually beneficial projects were quickly arranged
and within decades, small colonies composed of Danin and Human were flourishing
on nearby planets. With their greater skill in the life sciences, the Danin
found it relatively easy to establish self-supporting ecosystems with a minimum
of time and material. This ability freed a greater proportion of the Human
component to concentrate on industrial development. Cooperative colonies
quickly spread over the surrounding systems into adjacent Subsectors.
 For most of the history of this association, the attitude of the component
members toward outside entities was non-aggressive. Some two centuries ago, a
minor religious-political cult on Kalradin (Mandin - 0416) underwent an almost
explosive expansion for as yet incompletely understood reasons. The cult had a
most efficient and aggressive attitude toward conversion and expansion.
At about the same time a mutant strain of Danin arose with a lesser fertility
rate and a greater physical size, speed, and strength. With a lesser
reproductive drive, the energy of this variant Danin turned outward with a more
aggressive attitude towards outside dominance. While this strain normally would
not be significant in numbers due to the lower fertility, it was deliberately
bred for. It seems that the neighbouring state to Trailing was exerting extreme
political pressure on adjacent portions of the Human-Danin colonised areas. The
Human-Danin choose to resist that pressure with military force.
 The Danin proved not to be very adept at space manoeuvre of combat. The new
strain proved an adept warrior on land and so was bred in great numbers.
This freed large numbers of Humans for space duty since the Danin now formed
the home defence forces and the assault landing teams. Soon several sharp
clashes proved the efficiency of this arrangement and the pressure from
Trailing areas ceased.
 Now there were large numbers of unemployed warriors; the Humans among whom the
expansionist sentiment was prominent, and the Danin who also had an
expansionist element of warriors. These factions forced a political
reorganisation with a more rigid central authority based upon the military
command structure recently set up. Clashes with the Krax Confederation and
Marlan Primate soon occurred. A few local successes were scored but further
expansion would take more resources than the bulk of the essentially
non-aggressive Danin and Humans were willing to provide.
 During the subsequent operations much greater opposition was encountered from
both the opponents and the basically conservative internal structure. The Danin
developed a new strain of their species which was closer in biology and
attitudes to the basic stock, but was much more adapted to space conditions.
Emphasis on breeding the warrior strain was switched to the spacer strain. Over
the same time period, the Kalradnist cult lost much of its internal cohesion
and developed several divergent factions.
 At the present time, the higher levels of the government and military services
are filled with adherents of the former aggressive and expansionist philosophy.
The lower and mid levels have a much more cooperative and conciliatory attitude
towards their neighbours.
Imperial policy toward the Mandanin Co-Dominion is to placate the high levels
of authority, stall for time, and encourage advancement in the mid level to
positions of greater authority

"Notes on Fornast Sector","Fornast Sector","Notes on Fornast Sector
-----------------------
Fornast Sector was never fully developed by GDW or DGP (and any development
that may have been done by Paranoia Press or Judges' Guild has since been
declared non-canonical), although GDW did map out this sector in the
_Atlas_of_the_Imperium_ (1984).  In the Imperium Games release of 
_Marc_Miller's_Traveller_, it was declared that this sector, as well as
Delphi and Zarushagar sectors, would not be developed, and left as referee's
preserves.  The information here was taken from the published information
from the _Atlas_, and developed independently.  Its canonicity should therefore
be considered low at best; the _Atlas_ provided only the names of high
population worlds, the locations and starport ratings of all worlds, an 
indicator of which worlds were desert worlds, polity membership for worlds not 
in the Imperium (there were none in this sector), and identification of the
locations and types of bases in the sector.  All the rest is simply plausible
(I hope) development rooted in my fertile (or is that toxically contaminated?)
imagination.

"Fornast (called Rishurin by the Vilani) was on the trailing fringe of the Ziru","Fornast Sector","Fornast (called Rishurin by the Vilani) was on the trailing fringe of the Ziru
Sirka.  With limited Vilani jump capability, it proved difficult to probe into
Makhuniim (Ley), accessible only with the advanced (for the Vilani) Jump-2
capability developed late (just before the Consolidation Wars and the founding
of the Ziru Sirka).

Fornast is a sector of short Jump-1 mains connected by single 2-parsec jumps.
Most of the mains are oriented along a core-rim axis, although the two most
notable mains in the sector, the Derri and Tharrynra mains, provide spinward-
trailing access to the central and rimward areas of the sector respectively.
Inter-sector connectivity is best into Core sector and to the coreward areas
of Imperial space; the same astrographic deficiencies that limited Vilani
expansion in this region of space also operated to delay ultimate Terran and
Imperial expansion in the area as well.

Fornast sector boasts the following notable mains:

Madu (C) subsector is connected to Antares sector by the rimward end of the
Antares Main; most of Antares sector, and the rimward areas of the Julian
Protectorate, are accessible from here with Jump-1 capability.

The Spas Main connects the spinward half of Spas (B) subsector with the
trailing half of Cirqa (A) subsector, and extends from there into Aarna (E)
subsector.  A Jump-2 ship can use the Spas Main as a connector between the
Antares Main and the Ganad Main into Core Sector; the Spas Main also acts to
connect both mains to the Jump-1 main that leads from the spinward half of
Cirqa subsector through a corner of Core Sector and into Lishun; from the
Lishun end of this main, the Vilani Main is accessible to Jump-2.  In
addition, there is Jump-2 access to a mini-main that in turn gives Jump-2
access to the Derri Main in the center of the sector.  This confluence of
mains makes the core-spinward area of Fornast sector comparatively prosperous.

The Ganad Main from Core Sector has both of its ends in Fornast; much of Imaka
(I) subsector and the rimward portion of Aarna subsector make up the coreward
end of the main, with the trailing end of the main found in the spinward area
of Setten (M) subsector.  The body of the main covers most of the worlds in
Core subsector P, but there is no direct access from there to the Sylean Main.

The Derri Main covers most of the worlds in Akashganar (F) and Derri (G)
subsectors, and provides Jump-2 access to the Ganad Main at the spinward end.
Two small mains, both unnamed, provide connections via Jump-2 to the Antares
Main; the more spinward of the two also provides a similar connection to the
Spas Main, while the more trailing of the two also provides Jump-1 access to
Snogsta (D) subsector.

The Tharrynra Main stretches from Setten subsector, where it provides a Jump-2
connection to the Ganad Main, through Tharrynra (N) and Shumduur (O) subsectors,
into Zukhin (P) subsector.  Most of the worlds in Tharrynra and the rimward
two-thirds of Shumduur are on this main; the coreward third of Shumduur is a
mini-main on its own, which is accessible by Jump-2 from the Tharrynra Main.

The Dikhari Main services Dikhari (K) subsector and provides Jump-2 access to
connect the Derri and Tharrynra Mains, as well as the Shumduur mini-main.

"The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Asimikigir Confederation","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Asimikigir Confederation
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The region in which the Julian Protectorate lies contains the whole
range of Human-Vargr interactions, from outright hatred (in the coreward
areas, in Gashikan) to total integration (on Asimikigir itself).  The
Empires of Gashikan have historically represented the negative extreme,
where Human and Vargr will attempt to kill each other on sight.

The Asimikigir Confederation represents the other extreme, where human
and Vargr cooperate openly and willingly, and even form intimate
relationships (see "The Panet Relationship" under "Aliens of the
Protectorate"), all in a completely integrated dual-species culture.
Total equality is found throughout the Confederation, while the biological
and sociological differences between male and female, and between human
and Vargr, are fully accomodated.

The Asimikigir Confederation is also the home of the Menderes Corporations, 
the largest corporation in the Protectorate, and the only one that aspires
to megacorporate status.  The Menderes Corporation is fully diversified
and socially progressive; although it emphasizes mercantile issues over
social ones, it acts as an influence by example.  Menderes social policies,
though consistently downplayed by the company as simply good business, have
consistently been cited as the single most important contributor to the
good interrelationship that humans and Vargr have in the Confederation, and
in the rest of the Protectorate as well.

Tetusu-Dene Evaluation: 8+
The Asimikigir Confederation is a model of interspecies cooperation.  There
is a small amount of benign and voluntary social segregation; only the fact
that, on many worlds other than Asimikigir itself, the panet relationship is
viewed with some unease prevents a full 9 rating.  On Asimikigir itself, the
Tetusu-Dene Evaluation would unquestionably be 9.

"The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Constellation of Koekhon","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Constellation of Koekhon
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This mixed Human-Vargr state has Vargr in charge of the Executive
branch of government; Humans control the Judiciary.  Most Humans in the
area are of Solomani extraction, and there is a sizeable population
descended from deportees from Terra itself.  The Vargr population, like
that of most of the Protectorate, is primarily Irilitok Vargr, but
sizeable minorities of Urzaeng and Ovaghoun Vargr can also be found.

The Constellation's society is paradoxical in some ways; while Human/
Vargr cooperation is at a very high level, some of the strongest
bigotry of one race against the other can also be found here, primarily
among the Urzaeng Vargr communities, many of whom are descendants of
refugees from anti-Vargr pogroms in the Gashikan region, and among the
Human Image community on Jyestha House (Divide/Amdukan 1432), a
religious group that believes that Humans were created "in the image
of" their deity, and that other "supposedly intelligent" species are
merely a mockery of that deity's work, and unworthy of association with
those who are "truly intelligent".

The Constellation of Koekhon's central location within the protectorate
leaves it comparatively isolated from contact with states and cultures
from outside the Protectorate, and it maintains formal relations
within the Protectorate only with the Rukadukaz Republic.  In debates
in the Protectorate legislature, Koekhon delegates generally present an
isolationist viewpoint.

Tetusu-Dene Evaluation: 7
Although Humans and Vargr work well together here as elsewhere, it is 
unusual for them to be found together in social situations.  For the 
most part, the panet relationship common in the Asimikigir 
Confederation, and considered unremarkable elsewhere, is viewed as 
being somewhat perverted here, and demeaning to both parties.

"The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Hhkar Sphere","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Hhkar Sphere
--------------------------------------------------------

The Hhkar Sphere is the only member confederation of the Julian
Protectorate in which neither Human nor Vargr is the majority race.
Instead, the saurioid Hhkar dominate these planets.  The Hhkar initial
intrusion into the sector was hostile, and while the Hhkar have been
integrated into the Protectorate, there is still a good deal of
wariness about them and their intentions, and a well-staffed and
well-armed Star Legion base is maintained at Kargan as both a warning
and an insurance policy.

The Hhkar generally do not associate with other races for purposes
other than business; the most accurate Tetusu-Dene evaluation would
assign a 0 to the Hhkar Sphere, although it is felt that based on past
interactions, it would be better to assign a rating between 2 and 3.

It is a standing policy of the Hhkar Sphere that the Droyne community
on Ahbrazz is forbidden contact with non-Hhkar.  No reason for this
restriction has been given.

The three planets of the Lumda Dower are ruled by a constitutional monarchy
in which both humans and Vargr play an important part.  While the Lord of
Lumda, the head of the executive branch, is always a male human (though his
heir is a member of his wife's family), the judiciary is entirely in the
hands of Dower Vargr, and the legislature is bicameral, with each species
holding one chamber.

Tetusu-Dene Evaluation: 7H
While there is no mandatory segregation of Human from Vargr in the Lumda
Dower, social patterns indicate that many members of both species are
uncomfortable among the other.  While this is not unnatural, it is exhibited
in the Lumda Dower to a greater extent than in other member states.

The Commonwealth of Mendan is the only Member State of the Protectorate
that was originally part of the Second Empire of Gashikan.  Of the states
on or near the Mendan Main, it is second in influence and political power
only to the Asimikigir Confederation.

The Commonwealth of Mendan is the conservative voice in the Protectorate
Council, urging restraint in relations with other states, and generally
arguing against expansion of the Protectorate.

Internally, while the Commonwealth accepts the principle of equality
between Vargr and Human, some residual race hatred between the species
still exists, and Human and Vargr are found together or in cooperative
arrangements less often than elsewhere in the Protectorate.  These 
attitudes are changing, however slowly, and the extent of the change
explains to a great extent why the Commonwealth chose to affiliate itself
with the Protectorate rather than with the strongly anti-Vargr Third
Empire of Gashikan.

Tetusu-Dene Evaluation: 6H
Many worlds of the Commonwealth of Mendan rate a full 7; there are as many
that do not.  No world in the Commonwealth prohibits Vargr participation in
government, but institutionalized discrimination remains a major social
influence in the Commonwealth.

"The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Alliance of Ozuvon","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Alliance of Ozuvon
--------------------------------------------------------------

This Vargr-majority state of the Protectorate was originally formed by 
Vargr escaping from the Second Empire of Gashikan, and specifically the 
area now encompassed by the Commonwealth of Mendan.  The Vargr 
population is mixed Irilitok, Urzaeng, and Ovaghoun, with the Irilitok 
majority smaller than elsewhere in the Protectorate.  Resentment and 
hostility to Humans in general, and Humans of the Mendan Commonwealth 
in particular, are prevalent here, and on many of the worlds of the 
Alliance, Humans are treated as second-class members of society at 
best.

Tetusu-Dene Evaluation: 5V
It is vanishingly rare for a Human to achieve any sort of Alliance-wide 
governmental post.  On many worlds, Humans have the status of 
"untouchables", and on a small number of worlds, they are held in 
servitude that is different from slavery only on paper.  Other states 
and the Protectorate itself have formally protested, but little has 
been achieved as yet.

"The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Pirbarish Starlane","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Pirbarish Starlane
--------------------------------------------------------------

The Pirbarish Starlane takes its name from that of the Vilani authority
responsible for patrolling the Mendan Main prior to the collapse of the
Rule of Man.  Its capital, Lasla, was the second most important planet
in the region prior to the Julian War, and it served as a coordination
center for guerrilla resistance activity during Imperial occupation.
Although the Asimikigir Confederation has eclipsed it in importance, the
Pirbarish Starlane is still influential in the region.

Tetusu-Dene Evaluation: 7H
No world in the Pirbarish Starlane mandates different treatment of 
Human and Vargr; however, many worlds do have institutionalized social 
segregation.

"The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Rukadukaz Republic","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Rukadukaz Republic
--------------------------------------------------------------

The Rukadukaz Republic is one of the most influential members of the 
Protectorate, behind the Asimikigir Confederation and possibly the 
Commonwealth of Mendan.  The vast majority of trade with the Imperial 
Domain of Antares flows through the Republic, and the Imperial Division 
of the Menderes Corporations is based here.

The Republic is also the "front line" in the event of hostilities with 
the Imperium; there is no other Protectorate member state with as 
strong a permanent Star Legion presence as the Republic.  This presence 
has provided a boost to the Republic's shipbuilding industry; while in 
general, the high-tech and luxury ships built in the Protectorate are 
built by Vargr firms and yards in the Asimikigir Confederation, the 
shipyards of the Rukadukaz Republic are known for sturdy, absolutely 
reliable ships - when they can be obtained; it is not unusual for 
Rukadukaz shipyards to be concentrating on military contracts for 
either production or maintenance/overhaul.

The Rukadukaz Republic is one of the few Protectorate member states 
with a non-Irilitok majority among its Vargr; in fact, Irilitok Vargr 
are vanishingly rare in most of the Republic.  Virtually all Vargr in 
the Rukadukaz Republic are Ovaghoun; there are a few communities of 
Logaksu and Urzaeng Vargr on the spinward edge of the Republic.

Tetusu-Dene Evaluation: 8
Integration between Vargr and Human is almost as extensive here as in 
the Asimikigir Confederation.  On most issues involving interspecies 
relations, Rukadukaz attitudes will closely mirror Asimikigir 
attitudes.  In general, the Rukadukaz Republic will quietly follow the 
lead of the Asimikigir Confederation, but on those occasions when the 
Republic chooses to be proactive, they and the Asimikigir Confederation 
are a formidable team.

"The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Ukhanzi Coordinate","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Ukhanzi Coordinate
--------------------------------------------------------------

The Ukhanzi Coordinate is one of the three states that form the majority
of the so-called "Antares Crescent", an area that has historically had
close ties to the Imperial Domain of Antares.  The Ukhanzi Coordinate
differs from the other states of the region, as its relationship with the
Imperium is noticeably cooler than that of its neighbors; many of the Vargr
majority are descended from Imperial Vargr fleeing mistreatment.  The
appointment of Vargr Archdukes has affected the attitudes of Coordinate Vargr
less than those of Vargr elsewhere in the Protectorate; Coordinate Vargr
see Soegz and his successors first as part of the Imperial power structure,
and only second as Vargr.

Tetusu-Dene Evaluation: 7V
Many Vargr in the Ukhanzi Coordinate are cautious in their relationships with
Humans; this is a legacy not of the Race Wars, as it is elsewhere in the
Protectorate, but of mistreatment of Vargr by Imperial authorities.  Tensions
have improved remarkably over the past several decades; it is entirely likely
that a reevaluation within the next few decades will raise the evaluation to
a full 8.

"The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Vugurar Dominion","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Vugurar Dominion
------------------------------------------------------------

The Vugurar Dominion is a Vargr-majority state.  Its representatives in
the Protectorate Council tend to be outspoken on every issue, although
they are firmly committed to the principles of the Protectorate.  Many
of the most vocal advocates for Vargr equality throughout the region
are Vugurar citizens; there is a strong sensitivity in the Dominion to
anti-Vargr prejudice.

Tetusu-Dene Evaluation: 8
The race-consciousness of the Dominion has led to a very strong set of anti-
prejudice laws.  Overcoming residual hesitancy about strong integration on
the Asimikigir model is a major goal of the Dominion government; much of the
government-created entertainment is either set on Asimikigir or in the
Asimikigir Confederation, or is centered on Asimikigir citizens traveling in
the Dominion.  In either case, it is not unusual for a panet relationship to
be prominent in the story.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Marhaban (Lentuli/Empty Quarter 0426), in the Imperium, is the 
homeworld of the Bwaps or Newts, a minor alien species that resemble 
Terrestrial salamanders more than anything else.  Newts are regarded as 
bureaucrats par excellance, and have been since the days of the Vilani 
Imperium.  It is from that time that their presence in the area of the 
present-day Julian Protectorate dates.

The typical Newt is about 1.4m in height, and masses anywhere from 30
to 50kg.  They prefer environments of extremely high humidity,
experiencing various levels of discomfort as the humidity drops below
98%.  In humidity of less than 25%, a sealed environment suit is
required for the Newt to survive; at higher humidities, it will
generally suffice for a Newt to wear special garments designed to keep
their skin moist.

Newts range in color from yellow-green through green, blue, and brown;
each individual Newt has a unique pattern of body markings, generally
in a darker shade of their basic body color.  In areas of the skin that
lack intense coloring, the Newt has a bluish cast, due to blood whose
oxygen transporting compound is more analogous to hemocyanin than
hemoglobin, being based on copper instead of iron.

Newts are viewed by other species as being obsessed with order and
propriety; a Newt takes literally the proverbial phrase 'a place for
everything and everything in its place', going to great lengths to
ensure that everything is 'just so' and as it should be.  Trying to
rush a Newt, or encourage one to take 'shortcuts', is quite definitely
counterproductive, and will often earn a long lecture on the
proprieties of the situation.

Newt social interactions center around their basic philosophy, which is
an extension of 'a place for everything and everything in its place'.
Much of their time is spent discussing their place in the cosmos, and
ascertaining the place in the cosmos of the other.  It is their
'obsession' with this philosophy that makes them excellent candidates
for any job that requires painstaking care; Newts are found not only as
bureaucrats, but as accountants, historians, and scientists in the
'hard' sciences.

"The Julian Protectorate: Aliens of the Protectorate: The Panet Relationship","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: Aliens of the Protectorate: The Panet Relationship
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

On Asimikigir itself, integration and harmonious relations between
Human and Vargr have progressed farther than anywhere else in the
Asimikigir Confederation, or indeed in the Protectorate itself.  On
most other worlds, individual relationships between Human and Vargr are
often friendly; it is unusual for them to progress beyond that to
intimate (in a non-sexual sense).  On Asimikigir, it is common for
Human and Vargr to achieve a relationship whose closeness is matched
elsewhere only in the relationship between a person and a pet - except
that in the case of the relationship between a Human and a Vargr, there
is no sense of one member of the relationship being in any way
subordinate to the other.  This relationship is referred to as the
'panet' relationship, possibly from 'comPANion/pET'.

The panet relationship has been described as a recognition of the fact
that Humans and Vargr like each other, fundamentally.  Those who accept
the panet relationship as 'natural' point to the close relationship
between Humans and non-sophont canines that started on Earth in
prehistoric times, and which continues to this day.  They suggest that
the same psychological factors that operated to bring Humans and
canines together on Earth continue to operate to bring Human and Vargr
together; the fact that Vargr are sophonts as well adds an additional
measure of respect that does not normally exist in the relationship
with non-sophont canines, but in no way reduces the fundamental
attraction between the two species.

A Human and a Vargr in a panet relationship are free within certain 
relatively loose social limits to engage in behavior that might be 
considered "shocking" by either Humans or Vargr elsewhere.  For 
example, the Human member of the relationship may be seen to scratch or 
rub the Vargr member much as might be done to a non-sophont dog, and 
the Vargr will enjoy it; similarly, it is not unusual to see the Vargr 
member of a panet relationship to greet the Human member after a 
prolonged separation by placing his/her hands on the Human's shoulders 
and licking the Human's face enthusiastically.

The panet relationship is part of the "social scene" on Asimikigir; 
certain social functions require that an attendee bring a panet, much 
as others require a spouse or a friend of a particular type.

Members of a panet relationship often also have close relationships 
with others of their own species; in both Human and Vargr families, one 
or both parents may have panets, who are considered "part of the 
family", acting in the role of perhaps a "favorite uncle".  The result 
of these interlocked relationships is an "extended family" containing 
members of both species; it has been noted by psychologists of both 
species that the children of both species in such extended families are 
more likely to form panet relationships, and at an earlier age, than 
those who are not as exposed to panet relationships.

"The Julian Protectorate: The Fourth Resurgence: The Utovogh Tirades and","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: The Fourth Resurgence: The Utovogh Tirades and
the Rebellion
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A charismatic Vargr leader, Utovogh, was responsible for inciting anti-
Imperial feeling among Vargr outside the Protectorate.  While he has had
little effect within the Protectorate, the growing hostility to the
Imperium has been coupled with an increase in support for the Protectorate.
Concerned about possible belligerence, the Protectorate increased the size
of the Star Legion to its highest levels since the Julian War, and patrols
have been intensified.

With the assassination of Strephon and the fragmenting of the Imperium, the
Protectorate has emerged as a force for stability in the Antarean region and
the Vargr Enclaves.  Archduke Bzrk of the Imperial Domain of Antares has
shown himself to be a leader who has earned the support of both Humans and
Vargr in the region, and he is generally trusted to guide his Domain through
the problems of the Rebellion.

In 1117, Archduke Bzrk announced that the Domain of Antares would be forced
to "operate independently [of the Imperium] for a time", and renamed his
Domain as the League of Antares.  The following year, at Bzrk's request, the
League was admitted to the Protectorate as a member confederation, and Star
Legion detachments were soon in action against Imperial fleets under Lucan's
control.  Antareans and Julians were comrades-in-arms throughout 1118 and
1119, but resentment started to grow against Antares, for involving the
Protectorate in a war not properly theirs to fight.  The admission of two
confederations formerly part of the anti-Vargr Second Empire of Gashikan
provided a pretext for Bzrk to renounce the membership of the League in the
Protectorate, and non-Antarean detachments of the Star Legion were at the
same time withdrawn from the wars of the Rebellion.  The condition of
Lucan's forces had deteriorated to the point where the League of Antares
could stand on its own, and good relations between the League and the
Protectorate remain.

"The Julian Protectorate: Associated States: The Sarkan Constellation","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: Associated States: The Sarkan Constellation
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sarkan Constellation is a remnant of the Hormine League, a former medium
sized state in Mendan Sector which collapsed due to racial tensions.  The
majority of the inhabitants of the Constellation are Vargr, but the
government, such as it is, is firmly in the hands of Humans.

For the most part, the government of the Sarkan Constellation is unable 
to enforce its will on its member planets.  Its association with the 
Julian Protectorate is in name only, and it is not unknown for corsair 
bands based here to raid Julian shipping.

Tetusu-Dene Evaluation: 5H
In spite of the majority Vargr population, Humans dominate all aspects of
the Sarkan Constellation.  Vargr are barred from holding public office or
owning businesses.  Most public accommodations open to Vargr are considered
substandard.

"The Julian Protectorate: Member States: Rar Errall","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: Member States: Rar Errall
--------------------------------------------------

Rar Erral ("The Wolves' Warren") is unusual in the Protectorate, being 
a one-species state.  The entire population of the state is Vargr, with 
Urzaeng Vargr making up a significant majority.  These Vargr are 
generally refugees or the descendants of refugees from Gashikan and 
Trenchan; it is suspected, but not proven, that this state is used as a 
base for raids on planets in the Third Empire of Gashikan.

For many years, treatment of Human citizens of the Protectorate that 
entered the area was acceptable, if cold; non-Protectorate Humans were 
summarily expelled.  In recent years, even Protectorate citizens have 
been so expelled; formal protests have been repeatedly filed, and there 
is movement in the Protectorate legislature to revoke Rar Errall's 
membership in the Protectorate.  The Asimikigir Confederation and 
Commonwealth of Mendan representatives have led the countermovement, 
offering as justification the possibility of influence by example, or 
"constructive engagement".

Tetusu-Dene Evaluation: 2V
Violence against Humans has not been reported, but summary expulsion of 
Humans, regardless of the reason for their presence, has become common.

"The Julian Protectorate: Associated States: The Zuugabish Tripartite","Amdukan","The Julian Protectorate: Associated States: The Zuugabish Tripartite
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The Zuugabish Tripartite failed to achieve its goal of membership in 
the Julian Protectorate primarily due to resistance by the Asimikigir 
Confederation and the Rukadukaz Republic, both of which objected to the 
relationship between Human and Vargr within the Tripartite.

While Humans dominate the Tripartite, there is a sizeable and restive 
Vargr population.  Uprisings are common, and are often put down 
violently.  The presence of corsair bands in and around the Zuugabish 
Tripartite does nothing to improve the situation.

The weak central government has been unable to stop the establishment 
of corsair bases within its territory, or to prevent raids on its 
territory from outside; the three provincial governments are only 
slightly stronger, but are suspected of using the corsair bands for 
their own unofficial purposes.

Tetusu-Dene Evaluation: 5H
The primary obstacle to improved relations between Human and Vargr here 
is the direction of corsair activity against Human worlds, by corsairs 
based in the Confederation of Bammesuka and in Meshan sector.  It is 
likely that with a stronger central government, the situation in the 
Zuugabish Tripartite could be improved to the point where its candidacy 
for membership in the Julian Protectorate would be viable.  For now, 
Associated State status has been chosen, and the government is 
attempting to cultivate closer ties with the Confederation of Mendan, 
in hopes of receiving aid that will allow it to reach its goals.
