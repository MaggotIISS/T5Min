Dear Marc,

Hello, Happy Christmas, I hope you are well.

My horizons have broadened somewhat.  I am now selling on DTRPG.  I just wish to make sure that I am not taking any liberties with my graphics and data output.  I am charging:-

£1.50 per subsector of 5FW style pages (1 page per world) in colour.

£1.50 per subsector capital of T5 generated data and graphics from TravellerMap.

£15	400+pages
Vilani Campaign Recon:  9 Subsectors as above PLUS Squadron & Troop counters

£10	400+pages
Gushemege Campaign Recon:  9 Subsectors as above PLUS Squadron & Troop counters

£20	400+pages
Core Campaign Recon:  9 Subsectors as above PLUS Squadron & Troop counters

`Pay What You Want` files can be viewed for the Spinward Marches - including Squadron & Troop counters.  This way, people can see an example.

I would like permission to keep going and my aim is to catch up with TravellerMap and produce for all subsectors & capitals.

Roughlly 6000 worlds detailed so far.

More improvements to come...........

Thanks for the game.

I am willing to gladly donate any material to any of your sites/areas.
